React.js tutorial in PureScript
===============================

This is just a quick implementation of the React.js [tutorial][tutorial]

To view it in action:

1. `bower install` in this directory.
It has different dependencies.
1. `gulp example-tutorial` from the root directory.
Paths are tricky.
1. `python server.py` in this directory.
It needs a simple server since it's dishing off AJAX.
1. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in the browser and play around.
